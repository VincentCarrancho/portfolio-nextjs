            I have experience in Mobile Development using Flutter and SwiftUI; I
            have experience in making websites using React.js (using Next.js and
            vanilla React), and I have project management experience with a few
            technical projects under my belt.

            I am currently the SparkDev Program Manager in Upsilon Pi Epsilon
            (UPE) at Florida International University (FIU). I am responsible
            for overseeing a program in which we give students the opportunity
            to work on a STEM-based project for nine weeks. I am responsible for
            coordinating logistics, organizing events, leading my committee, and
            moderation of the program.
